Basically Azure service are Useful that if we had the same code using traditional dotnet application.
Here we are exploring azure blob storage which is used to store the data on the cloud.
If our requirment to upload large size of data like images,videos,files on the cloud,So Azure storage is best to use.
Here Developed an application using dotnet to upload items to Azure Blob and interact with container.Then we will explain the diffrent access level with Blob storage and See how we can restrict acess Using SAS token.
Then our Next service is Azure Function.Azure function Is serverless concept of cloud native design that allow a piece of code to be deployed and executed without any need of Server infrastructure,WebServer/Configuration.
Azure Function Can also be Written in Multiple Language Like C#,Java,Python and TypeScript.So using Azure Function,We can only focus on piece of code that Matters Most.
All other Configuration handled by Azure Function
Then in this Project We will discuss about Logic App.So Logic App is a cloud based platform for creating and running automated workflow that integrate with our application,data Service and System.
Using this platform,We can build  highly Scalable Integration Solution for our business Scenario using built in connectors.
The best part about logic app is that you can build them easily  by using Webflow Designer Which doesnot require Coding.
Then our Last Service that we will be looking Azure Cache for Redies.It is fully managed In-memory Cache that enables high Performance and Scalable Architecture.
